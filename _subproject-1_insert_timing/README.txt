Idea to testing insert timing (perhaps other timing too).

maybe relearning:	triggers/procedures, variables, math
maybe learning:		using D3.js with php. (maybe followup with dynamic data? two pages input and display)

one procedure or two?
datetime(6) vs timestamp(6) any difference?



BUILD:
**DEPENDENCY:  Make certain parent is built in .. directory!! 
wjr_drop_tables.sh
wjr.sh

RUNNING from MySQL Console:
  call runTest();

TO SEE RESULTS:
  select * from mysqltiming;
